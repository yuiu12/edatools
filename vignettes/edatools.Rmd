The `edatools` package is a demonstration project for learning how to 
build an R package. It comes from chapter 21 of [R in Action (3rd ed.)](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-third-edition).

The package has one main function for describing a data frame, and two generic functions.

```{r example}
library(edatools)
df_info <- contents(happiness)
print(df_info, digits=3)
plot(df_info)
```
